# This files was added by a devbox script from our devops tools project and is maintained there:
# https://github.com/onlinecity/devops-tools
#
# The specific editorconfig file is inherited "through generations" of devops teams in OnlineCity,
# so when added as part of devops-tools we don't know they origin of the file, nor the reasons of
# choices in it.
# However it is a good fit with current code base, so we keep it as is for now.
# Bue Petersen added it here, who received the file as addded from Tjalfe MÃ¸ller who used it together with Adam Tulenius and others - all earlier devops team members.

# Don't scan for other configs, this is considered our topmost file in the hierarchy
# as we add it to each project.
