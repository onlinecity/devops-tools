# WARNING: This file is managed by devbox tooling project.
# DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE DIRECTLY - create a ansible.cfg.local file instead.
#
# This ansible.cfg file, is a merge of two files:
# * a ansible.cfg.dist file from our devops tooling project
# * and a possible the local ansible.cfg.local
#
# Merge is done by a simple tool named crudini and from a devbox script command.
# Since comments are stripped, we always merge into a new file with a
# a comment (the one you read now).
# Unfortunately comments from the .dist and .local files in those, as they are not merged.
# Notice also we do not support merging lists, appending to values currently.
# See devbox tooling project for more details and future improvements:
# https://github.com/onlinecity/devops-tools
# Regarding merging Ansible configuration files, it is a long awaited feature, not yet done:
# https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/17914
# as following links, proposal #35: https://github.com/ansible/proposals/issues/35
# And the go-to workaround we have been inspired from: https://gitlab.com/-/snippets/1851171
# However, it do not support merging lists, as for example this unmaintained Python script do: https://github.com/sshnaidm/ansible-config-merge
# That script could be improved, to use a dynamic gathering list of the variables of type 'list' from https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/devel/lib/ansible/config/base.yml
# instead of the hardcoded one that guy uses.
# However we haven't needed that yet.
