# DevOps Tools
Tools for DevOps projects

## Devbox plugins

In the devbox-plugins folder are plugins for our devbox setup. Plugins are installed by adding the plugin to the projects devbox.json file in the include section. The url looks like standard github urls so we can use `ref` to target a specific tag or branch. Note that this is not a documented feature by devbox, only `dir` as parameter.

Example:

```json
  ...
  "include": [
    "github:onlinecity/devops-tools?ref=master&dir=devbox-plugins/base-config"
  ]
  ...
```

### Base config

This plugin has the baseline of tools needed for a DevOps project.

This includes:
  * Python, including a virtual environment
  * Pre-commit and linting hooks
  * tfswitch, tflint and terraform-docs for working with terraform
  * Taskfile

#### Python and pip

The plugin creates a python virtual envrionment, activates it and installs pip requirements. Note that it expects a `requirements.txt` in the root of the project for pip installation to work. If your requirements file is located elsewhere, you can create a "root" requirements.txt with a link to your other requirements file.

Example `requirement.txt`:

```
-r configure/requirements.txt
```

#### Terraform

The plugin does not install terraform but instead installs tfswitch to help with getting the correct terraform version. We require our terraform project to define the terraform version with `required_version` and then use tfswitch to install it.

#### Scripts

The base config plugin includes some scripts to help bootstrap a new project.

Available scripts:
  * __bootstrap-envrc-private__ - this command will setup direnv for using a private .envrc file
  * __bootstrap-pre-commit__ - this command will create a basic pre-commit config with yamllint and tflint
  * __bootstrap-taskfile__ - this command will create a taskfile including common taskfile from the repo
  * __bootstrap-release-please__ - this command will create a release-please github action file using the __simple__ release type
  * __bootstrap-ansible__ - this command will create a basic ansible.cfg file and the `configure` folder

#### TODO (future plans ?)

* If needed we could split the base config into optional plugins eg. a python plugin, a terraform plugin etc.
* Consider if some of the bootstrap scripts should be named something with `configure` as they configure e.g. Ansible with our standard setup, as well as allow us to later update the configuration and keep them aligned.
  * The `configure` steps can also be used to update projects to latest standards and common configuration from so called `.dist` files in this devops tooling project. This requires some kind of "merge" step, which are technology dependent, like crudine for Ansible. Such ones exists also for Python pip requirements files, json and yaml so it would be pretty easy to extend the proof-of-concept done for `ansible.cfg` to `requirements.txt`, and `requirements.yaml` as well to keep used common Python packages and Galaxy resources across projects in sync. Such effort should also be documented in our tooling docs then as a common approach.
  * With such a configure approach, we can also automate with dependabot, so when there are new version of our devbox plugin, we run configure commands in the projects and they make PRs if configuration are updated.
* devbox can write a readme, which we could automatically maintain and keep in sync with actual tooling for a project. It is huge, so just as a second readme linked to from project readme. Currently it contain user specific paths in the autogenerated docs, it might improve (or else used `sed` cmd to clean up). Link to the readme from the project readme under  "usage" or tooling section or something.
